## Inspiration

Today we are Living in a world, with inconsistent climate change. One of the reason for this inconsistent climate change is carbon footprint. The main gas that contributes to carbon footprint is CO2. Carbon footprint is basically emission of green house gases due to various products. Digital carbon footprint is the carbon emitted due to transfer of data over internet. This digital carbon footprint contributes to 4% of green house gases. Every mail generates 4g of CO2, every hour youtube generates 6g of CO2, etc. We want to do something using tech to reduce this carbon emissions. Hence we propse hedwig platform which will help to reduce carbon emissions.

## What it does

Hedwig reduces CO2 emission by optimising technology workflow. Like Hedwig allows you to unsubscribe from all spam mails, compresses your attachments before sending mails, allos you to close internet consuming processes, sleep shutdown your system from andriod, etc.

## How we built it

We built it using various technologies like Flask, React, Android etc. The idea was to develop tools in order to reduce the internet consumption of computers. Thus, we thought of tools like monitoring the mails from various news-letters (HedMail) , shutting down or sleeping PC from android device (Hed ProOS), compressing files so that data transfer through internet becomes less (HedCompress), monitoring processes in system which use internet in background (HedProcess). We used languages like Python, Javascript, Kotlin, HTML, CSS etc for making this project.

## Challenges we ran into

Developing 4 products inside one project in a limited time took our sleeps off! We had to work with more than one framworks or technologies at a time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of us that we managed to develop all the 4 proposed products in time!

## What we learned

We learned various new technologies and frameworks during this project. They include Android, Kotlin, React, Gatsby etc.

## What's next for Hedwig

There are many future products which can be included in HedWig such as HedConsult which will gather information about internet usage of all the computers in an organisations and give insights to organisations about reducing the carbon footprint of organisation with the help of usage statistics in form of graphs or images. We can also improve the existing products in Hedwig too.
